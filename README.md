1. Project Description: What your site does and who it is for
2. Database Schema: An image of your entity relation diagram (ERD) exported from
pgAdmin showing your tables and relationships
3. User Roles: Explanation of each role and what they can do
4. Test Account Credentials: Username or email for one account of each role type, do
not include the password in the README, but use P@$$w0rd! for all users
5. Known Limitations: Any features you did not complete or bugs you are aware of

My project is a used car dealership site. I do not really have a need for a personal site, and I struggle
to come up with ideas. This also sounded fun.
